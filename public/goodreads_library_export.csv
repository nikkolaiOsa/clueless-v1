When a tabloid misunderstanding about a night out in town jeopardises work, Luc resorts to fake-dating the cute, arrogant lawyer Oliver to rehab his image. Oliver has his own agenda, needing to bring a date to his parents' anniversary party.<br/><br/>This is a pretty straightforward frenemies-to-lovers story, but that doesn't make any less enjoyable. -1 star for the length - though it wasn't ""War and Peace""-long, it could've used with some serious editing to bring down the length a bit. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and looking forward to the next two books!",,,1,0

Not this book! We are dropped right into the mystery with who I would say is the main protagonist, 25-year-old Libby Jones, one of three POVs we get  in the story. All three POVs are set in the present, with one narrating the past events. One of the narrators could be considered as unreliable, which adds to the mystery, but I feel like everything was cleared up at the end<br/><br/>The pacing is good, I didn't feel bombarded by information after a lull in the story; we are fed the information in a steady pace. I personally didn't see the twists and turns coming, which is also quite rare for me with these types of books, which made the read even more enjoyable for me.<br/><br/>-.5 stars for multiple POVs, which a pet peeve of mine, otherwise it was an excellent read that I would totally recommend!",,,1,0
